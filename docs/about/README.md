title: How Anagolay works
---

## The Network

The Anagolay network is a distributed, peer-to-peer network formed by Anagolay peers who participate as validators. Anagolay is built on top of the [Substrate](https://substrate.dev) framework and it utilizes all of its features for governing, communication and block creation. More information on how Substrate works can be found [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/).

With Anagolay network you can create transparent proceses ( [Rules](./rule.md) ) and libraries ( [Operations](./operation.md) ) to create the [Proofs](./proof.md) and [Statements](./statement.md).

## Anagolay nodes

_Anagolay nodes_ or _Anagolay clients_ are peers that sync the Anagolay blockchain and validate the messages in every block, which, once applied generate global state.

## Consensus

Since Anagolay Network is a substrate based, it inherits the same consensus rules and governing functionalities. If you are interested in reading about it head [to official Substrate knowledgebase](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus).
