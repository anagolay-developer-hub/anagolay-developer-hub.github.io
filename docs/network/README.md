# Introduction

The decentralized protocol for creating multimedia and content [ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership), its discovery, timestamping and monetization.

SensioNetwork is a decentralized protocol for creating multimedia and content ownerships, its discovery, ProofOfExistence and monetization.

SensioNetwork is a decentralized protocol that empowers content creators to sign, permanently record, and claim statements about their ownerships and copyrights, giving them opportunity to license their work and get paid.

Using digital signatures and blockchain technology, SensioNetwork empowers multimedia content creators to sign, permanently record, and claim statements about their ownership and copyrights, giving them opportunity to license their work and get paid.

Sensio Protocol aims to provide:

- an easy and cheap way to store the ownership claims
- tamper-proof and publicly available ownership claims
- inherited copyrights for digital media (photos, videos, music)
- smart contracts for monetization

## Consensus

Sensio Network uses nominated proof of stake (NPoS) as well as finality algorithm [GRANDPA](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-consensus-part-2-grandpa/) and a block production engine [BABE](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-consensus-part-3-babe/) developed by [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/)

As a [parachain](../glossary.md.md#parachain) on Polkadot network, Sensio has its shared security.

To revert the block on Sensio Network an attacker would have to revert the entire Polkadot system.

SN nodes are collecting transactions and producing state transition proofs for the the Relay chain validators. In the Polkadot ecosystem they are known as Collators. These are light nodes that do not require much power and can be run even on a smartphone.

## Architecture

Sensio Network is a Substrate based blockchain with shared security and builtin Hybrid Consensus.

## Token

::: tip
Feedback is welcome
:::

Suggested name is `THT` as per [definition of Sensio word](#etymology-and-definition), full name would be `THOUGHT`.

`THT` is a utility token used in Sensio Network to pay for the network fees, user subscriptions and incentive layer.

Acquiring the THT token will be possible through the exchanges or as a reward for performed actions on the network.

Potential actions could be :

- [successful participation](../glossary.md.md#successful-participation) in training the AI models for better image recognition
- selling the license/copyright/ownership ([p2p Market](p2p-marketplace.md))
- validating the network (yearly earning)
- host the data? (pinning in IPFS style)
